            <p className="core-text-body text-core-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Founded in 2015, Physio in Motion began as a vision to create a different kind of physiotherapy clinicâ€”one that prioritized patient experience and outcomes above all else. Our founder, Dr. Sarah Johnson, recognized the need for a more holistic, patient-centered approach to physiotherapy care in the Vancouver community.

            <p className="core-text-body text-core-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Starting with a small clinic and a commitment to excellence, we have grown to become a trusted healthcare provider in Vancouver. Our success is built on the relationships we've formed with our patients and the positive outcomes we've achieved together.

            <p className="core-text-body text-core-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Today, we continue to evolve and adapt, incorporating the latest research and treatment techniques while maintaining our core values of compassion, integrity, and clinical excellence.
