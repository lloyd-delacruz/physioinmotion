Redesign and fix the navigation bar across all pages of the site.
Current navigation bar is inconsistent:

Text alignment is broken — text appears in different positions across pages.

Colors are inconsistent — navbar colors do not match the landing page theme.

Overall styling is not aligned with the current CoreNewport-inspired theme.

✅ Requirements:

The navigation bar must be identical across all pages — Home, About, Services, Our Team, Contact.

Navigation items must be:

Horizontally aligned

Consistently spaced

Same font and font weight as used in the landing page (CoreNewport-style bold headings, clean body text).

Navbar background and text colors must match the landing page color scheme:

Deep blue background (or transparent over hero video, if on Home page with overlay that matches theme).

White or light grey text for nav items.

On hover: use subtle color change consistent with CoreNewport style (lighter blue or white underline).

Active page indicator: clear visual cue for current page (underline or text color shift).

Sticky behavior:

Navbar must stay sticky on scroll (fixed to top).

If hero has a video background: navbar should appear over the video with correct contrast.

Mobile responsiveness:

Use a hamburger menu on mobile and tablet screens.

Mobile menu styling must match the desktop theme — deep blue background, white/light grey text, consistent spacing.

✅ Code structure:

Navbar should be a single reusable component (e.g., Navbar.tsx or Navigation.tsx).

Do not duplicate nav code across pages.

Navbar component must dynamically highlight the active page.

Navbar styles must pull from the same theme settings used on the landing page (Tailwind config / shadcn/ui theme).

✅ Do not:

Do not use hardcoded styles or inconsistent inline CSS.

Do not use mismatched font weights, sizes, or colors.

Do not allow text to shift or misalign between pages.

✅ Summary:
Redesign and rebuild the navbar so it is:

Uniform across all pages

Styled consistently with the CoreNewport-inspired landing page

Fully responsive

Accessible

Clean and professional
