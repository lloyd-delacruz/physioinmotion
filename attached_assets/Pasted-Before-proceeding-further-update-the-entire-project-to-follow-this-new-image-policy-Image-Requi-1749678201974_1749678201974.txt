Before proceeding further, update the entire project to follow this new image policy:

✅ Image Requirements:

Use dummy photos for now — AI-generated or high-quality royalty-free placeholders.

All photos must convey modern, active, vibrant physiotherapy and movement themes.

NO stocky "old clinic", dark, or dry-looking photos.

Style should match a modern Vancouver, Canada clinic serving a diverse, active population.

✅ Sources:

You may use AI-generated images as placeholders.

Alternatively, use royalty-free images from trusted free sources (Unsplash, Pexels) with attribution if needed.

✅ Photo Tone & Style:

Diverse, inclusive (reflect Vancouver’s multicultural demographics).

Mix of indoor clinical images (hands-on therapy, rehab exercises) and active lifestyle images (athletes, walking, stretching).

Avoid heavily staged stock imagery or purely "fitness influencer" photos.

Target the feeling of professional care, personalized treatment, movement-focused recovery.

✅ Hero Section:

Replace current image with a dynamic, movement-focused AI-generated image or placeholder.

Example: adult athlete mid-stretch, physiotherapist assisting patient, outdoor active lifestyle in Vancouver-like setting.

✅ Services Page (Phase 3):

Each ServiceCard image must follow this new photo guideline.

Dummy images acceptable — use AI-generated or placeholder with correct alt text.

No default generic stock photos.

✅ Our Team Page (Phase 4 upcoming):

Use AI-generated placeholders for team member photos.

Style: friendly, approachable, diverse representation, professional clinic attire.

✅ Implementation:

Replace all images currently in the project to align with this policy.

Ensure proper alt text placeholders are present for each image.

All images must fit cleanly within the site’s design — consistent spacing, responsive behavior.

✅ DO NOT:

Do not use random stock photos that do not match the tone.

Do not use old clinical photos with outdated equipment.

Do not use generic images of "doctor shaking hands" or "clipboard writing".
