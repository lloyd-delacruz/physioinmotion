I want to recreate and improve the landing page (Home page Hero section) of Physio in Motion clinic website.
Do not copy the dry look of https://oakridgephysio.ca — I want a more modern, vibrant, and engaging Hero section.

Follow these specific instructions:

✅ Design Tone / Visual Style:

Colour palette: modern, vibrant, health/wellness–focused (light blues, teals, fresh greens, white space — avoid dark brown, beige)

Use gradient backgrounds or soft gradients for visual depth

Include subtle animation (fade-in on hero text, button hover effects, slight parallax or zoom effect if background image is used)

✅ Hero Section Content:

Large background image (athlete / active person / physiotherapy-related action shot — placeholder image for now)

Overlay with slight gradient to make text readable

Headline text: "Move Better. Live Better."

Subheadline text: "Personalized physiotherapy & rehabilitation in [City Name], Canada" (placeholder for city)

Prominent Book an Appointment button (links to JaneApp)

Secondary button: Learn More (scrolls to Services section on page)

✅ Animation/Effects:

Hero text should have fade-in animation on page load

Buttons should have smooth hover effect (color shift or slight scale up)

Optional: background image can have very subtle parallax scroll effect

✅ Responsiveness:

Hero section must display perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile

On mobile, background image should center around the subject (not cropped weirdly)

Text should remain readable on all devices

✅ Photo guidance:

Use a placeholder image of an athlete, active adult, or physiotherapy-related treatment — NOT stock images of old clinic walls or dry equipment

The photo should communicate movement, recovery, and vitality

✅ Code Structure:

Use modern CSS or Tailwind CSS — NO inline CSS or old style hacks

Hero section in its own component (Hero.jsx or Hero.tsx)

Animation implemented via CSS transitions or lightweight animation libraries (like Framer Motion or CSS keyframes)

Follow accessibility best practices (alt text, proper headings)

✅ DO NOT DO THESE:

Do not use the colour scheme from OakridgePhysio.ca (brown and beige)

Do not use stock images of hands-on-shoulders, elderly in wheelchairs, or “generic” medical feel

Do not clutter the Hero with too much text
