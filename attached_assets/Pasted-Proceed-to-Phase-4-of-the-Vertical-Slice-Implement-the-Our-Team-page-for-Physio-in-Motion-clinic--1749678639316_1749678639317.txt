Proceed to Phase 4 of the Vertical Slice:
Implement the Our Team page for Physio in Motion clinic.

Purpose:
This page should introduce the clinic’s physiotherapists and key staff members.
It should create a sense of trust, friendliness, and professional expertise.
It must look modern and visually consistent with the rest of the site.

✅ UI Framework:

Use shadcn/ui components and UX patterns for consistency.

Follow the uniform blue colour scheme defined previously.

✅ Page Structure:

Page title (H1): "Meet Our Team"

Short introductory paragraph (2–3 sentences) explaining the clinic’s philosophy and team approach to care.
→ Use placeholder text for now.

✅ Team Member Cards:
Each team member must be displayed as a card or tile in a responsive grid layout.

Each TeamMemberCard should include:

Photo placeholder:

Use an AI-generated or royalty-free image (no stocky "business headshots").

Style: friendly, professional, approachable.

Diverse representation reflecting Vancouver’s multicultural community.

Name: H3 heading

Role/Title: e.g. Registered Physiotherapist, Clinic Director, etc.

Short Bio: 3–4 sentences max, dummy text (will be replaced later).

✅ Number of Team Members to Display:

Display at least 4 team members as placeholders.

Example roles:

Registered Physiotherapist

Senior Physiotherapist

Clinic Director

Client Services Coordinator

✅ Layout Guidance:

Responsive grid:

Desktop: 3–4 columns

Tablet: 2 columns

Mobile: 1 column (stacked vertically)

Cards must have consistent spacing, padding, and alignment.

Photo should be styled to match card — e.g. circular avatar or rounded square, consistent sizing.

Text alignment should be clean — Name + Role above the Bio.

✅ Accessibility:

Use semantic HTML (headings, sections, alt text).

All photos must have alt text placeholders.

✅ Animations:

Subtle hover effect on TeamMemberCard (slight scale up or shadow).

On page load, cards can fade in (optional).

✅ Responsiveness:

Must work well on all screen sizes.

No layout breakage when adding/removing team members.

✅ Code Structure:

Create a TeamMemberCard component (TeamMemberCard.tsx or TeamMemberCard.jsx).

Map an array of team members to render the cards — do not hardcode individual cards.

Ensure the array is easily extensible — I should be able to add more team members later by editing the array.

✅ DO NOT:

Do not hardcode all team members directly in JSX.

Do not use inconsistent image styles or sizes.

Do not use business-suit headshots — physiotherapy clinics should feel approachable and movement-focused.

Do not introduce random colours — stay with uniform blue theme and consistent shadcn/ui styling.
