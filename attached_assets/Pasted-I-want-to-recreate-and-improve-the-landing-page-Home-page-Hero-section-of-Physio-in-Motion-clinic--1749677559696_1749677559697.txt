I want to recreate and improve the landing page (Home page Hero section) of Physio in Motion clinic website.

Reference site https://oakridgephysio.ca is too dry — do not copy its colours or visual style.
I want a modern, vibrant Hero section and landing page built with the following design system:

✅ UI Library & Components:

Use shadcn/ui components as much as possible — consistent buttons, typography, spacing.

Follow shadcn/ui design and UX patterns.

✅ Colour Scheme (Uniform):

Primary colour: Blue tone (use Tailwind blue-500 to blue-700 range for primary accents)

Secondary accents: Light neutrals (white, gray-100, gray-200)

Do not introduce random colours — the entire site must follow this uniform blue-focused scheme

Hero background should subtly incorporate blues (gradients, overlays, or image tones)

✅ Hero Section Content:

Large background image (athlete, active person, or physiotherapy-related — placeholder)

Overlay with subtle gradient if needed (blue-tinted overlay allowed)

Hero Headline: "Move Better. Live Better."

Hero Subheadline: "Personalized physiotherapy & rehabilitation in [City Name], Canada"

Primary Button: "Book an Appointment" (links to JaneApp)

Secondary Button: "Learn More" (scrolls to Services section)

✅ Animations:

Fade-in on Hero text (on page load)

Smooth hover effects on buttons (scale up or subtle background change)

Optional: subtle parallax on background image — but lightweight and non-distracting

✅ Responsiveness:

Fully responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile

Text and buttons readable and aligned across all screen sizes

Hero background image should scale properly — no odd cropping on mobile

✅ Photo Guidance:

Use placeholder image of an active adult, athlete, or dynamic physiotherapy scene — conveying movement and vitality

No dry clinic rooms, no elderly-only imagery

Use placeholders from Unsplash or Pexels — free, license-compliant

✅ Code Structure:

Component-based (Hero component in Hero.tsx or Hero.jsx)

Use shadcn/ui components for buttons, text, containers

Use Tailwind CSS utilities where applicable

No inline styles

Accessible HTML5 structure

✅ DO NOT:

Do not use brown, beige, or dry neutral backgrounds

Do not introduce inconsistent colours — the site must follow the blue uniform scheme

Do not clutter Hero with extra text
