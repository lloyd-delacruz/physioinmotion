Implement the About page for Physio in Motion clinic.
In this phase, also apply SEO best practices globally across all pages.

✅ Global Image Handling Update:
From this phase forward, and retroactively for existing pages:

All images must be AI-generated using DALL·E.

DALL·E images should match the clinic’s tone:

Modern, movement-focused, positive physiotherapy themes.

Inclusive, diverse representation (reflect Vancouver’s multicultural community).

Clean, professional, high visual quality.

All previous placeholder images on Hero, Services, and Our Team pages must be replaced with new DALL·E-generated images matching this guideline.

✅ Alt Text:

All DALL·E images must include clear, descriptive alt text placeholders.

Do not leave alt text empty.

✅ About Page Purpose:
The About page must communicate the clinic’s story, mission, philosophy, and local community connection.
It is a trust-building page for both patients and search engines.

✅ UI Framework:

Use shadcn/ui components and UX patterns for consistent styling.

Follow the uniform blue colour scheme already defined.

✅ Page Structure:

Page title (H1): "About Physio in Motion"

Short introduction paragraph at the top (2–3 sentences).

Sections to include:

Our Mission — H2 heading, 1–2 paragraphs (placeholder text).

Our Philosophy — H2 heading, 1–2 paragraphs (placeholder text).

Our Story — H2 heading, 2–3 paragraphs (placeholder text about the clinic’s history, values, founder story).

Our Community Commitment — H2 heading, optional 1–2 paragraphs (highlighting connection to Vancouver community and local values).

✅ Images:

Include at least 1 large DALL·E-generated hero/banner image at the top of the About page.

Optionally include 1–2 more DALL·E-generated images within the body (e.g. in Philosophy or Community Commitment sections).

Follow visual tone guidance: movement, vitality, wellness, physiotherapy, inclusive representation.

✅ Responsiveness:

Page must be fully responsive across all devices.

Images must scale appropriately — no distortion or poor cropping.

✅ SEO Optimization — About Page:

Meta title: "About Physio in Motion | Vancouver Physiotherapy Clinic"

Meta description: "Learn about the mission, philosophy, and story of Physio in Motion — your trusted physiotherapy clinic in Vancouver, Canada."

Headings structured correctly (H1 → H2 → H3).

All images must have alt text.

✅ Global SEO Optimization — All Pages:
Apply SEO optimization across Home, Services, Our Team, Contact, About:

Meta title placeholders for each page.

Meta description placeholders for each page.

Clean heading structure.

✅ Code Structure:

Do not hardcode content inline — structure content properly.
